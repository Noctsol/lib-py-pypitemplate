# Guide on how to Manually use PYPI
(This is really just for reference. Don't be noob and do automated pushes)
1. Make some repo and generate some class with some function in it to use
2. Manually create a *setup.py* file in the root directory with the following contents and fill it out:
```
import setuptools

with open("README.md", "r", encoding="utf-8") as fh:
    long_description = fh.read()

setuptools.setup(
    name="example-pkg-YOUR-USERNAME-HERE",
    version="0.0.1",
    author="Example Author",
    author_email="author@example.com",
    description="A small example package",
    long_description=long_description,
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject",
    project_urls={
        "Bug Tracker": "https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/issues",
    },
    classifiers=[
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    package_dir={"": "src"},
    packages=setuptools.find_packages(where="src"),
    python_requires=">=3.6",
)
```
3. On your local computer, open CMD, and change to the root directory of your project using *cd [path]*
4. Run *python setup.py install* to install all the prequisite items to package python
5. Run *python -m pip install --upgrade build* to upgrade the tools used to compile tto a Python Artifact
6. Run *python -m build* to compile
7. Run *python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine* to upgrade/install the thing that actually uploads the packages
8. Run *py -m twine upload -u \_\_token\_\_ -p {pypiApiToken}* to upload to PYPI
    - Alternatively, you can run *py -m twine upload -u {pypiUser} -p {pypiPass}*
